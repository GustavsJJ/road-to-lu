    "HOME_DESC": "Where it all begins",
    "HOME1": "My houses are located in two different places in both Ogre and Carnikava. And even though I drive to the university from both of these places, the road to the university does not change significantly, because in both cases the distance has to be covered by train and getting to the Riga Central Train Station. This time I will tell you about the way from Ogre to the University of Latvia.",
    "HOME2": "My journey starts in my home - Ogre. The house is at the top of the hill and every morning I have the opportunity to see from above, through my window, over the whole of Pārogre. Home is especially important to me because I'm more introverted person and I like to spend a lot of time alone and doing one of my hobbies or watching something on Youtube. I also have to help my dad with homework, because since we have not lived in Ogre for a long, there are many things that are not yet in a satisfactory stage and need repair. And, of course, due to distance learning and work, my home has become a small office, which does not worsen the situation, but rather even improves it.",
    "HOME3": "When I have washed and had breakfast, I am ready to go out of the house and go to Pārogre station.",

    "OGRE_DESC": "The journey continues",
    "OGRE1": "I have been living in Ogre relatively recently and have not lived here since childhood. Before living in Ogre and Carnikava, I was a resident of Riga. And even though I have only lived in Ogre for about 4 years, I believe that I have settled in this place enough and it is a great pleasure to live here. Ogre is beautiful with its mountains and interesting forests. Therefore, in my free time I am very fond of riding a bike to the many interesting places of Ogre, such as the Blue Mountains of Ogre. It's like a little trip or even an adventure with a mysterious ending, especially when the chosen destination is picked randomly. In addition, it is sometimes interesting to go outside the borders of Ogre, for example, to Ikšķile or even Koknese.",
    "OGRE2": "When I arrive at Pārogre station, I wait for my train, and since I am already used to the time when I have to leave home, my boredom time is relatively short, and finally when the train has come I go inside and continue my journey to university.",

    "VIEWS_DESC": "Landscapes and  fantasy",
    "VIEWS1": "Covering distance by train takes up quite a bit of my time but unconsciously I always find some interesting way to fill that time. One of these ways is looking out the train window. This activity has fascinated me for a very long time and I think even since childhood. Since I was bored at many times as a child, I quickly learned that I could use fantasy for my entertainment. And looking out the window, this fantasy sometimes comes alive. And so I can go by train for a long time as if doing nothing.",
    "VIEWS2": "Nature is especially close to me and as I mentioned before I like to ride a bike through forests or other natural objects. A large piece of the whole train route consists of various forest or meadow landscapes which I really like. Also sometimes at school or university I have felt that nature plays a role in my mind, because sometimes a sketch with a view of nature, which I have just drawn, suddenly appears on my notebooks. This is probably the reason why I choose natural objects as a theme in my other works, for example, in the waterfall abstraction work shown above.",

    "MUSIC_DESC": "Melody of the journey",
    "MUSIC1": "As I said I have a lot of time on the train, and although I can have a good time looking out of the train window there are times when it also starts to get boring. I often open the phone and watch the news, read articles from Reddit or Facebook but beside that one of my favorite activities is listening to music. Music is also a thing close to me, because when I was an infant my mother used to play classical music; according to her stories I liked it very much. I still like it and I enjoy listening to classical music, old pop music, rock and even EDM. And what's more it can all be combined with looking through a window and fantasizing.",
    "MUSIC2": "I myself have been playing guitar for a long time but more to improve my mood than to perform on stage. Together I have two guitars which both I love to play. One of my guitars is a classical or in other words Spanish guitar that I learned to play from the beginning. The guitar that appears next to it is my electric Epiphone \"Les Paul\" type guitar which in return can give the melody more power and give a new sound to the previously taught songs.",

    "ORIGO_DESC": "Off the train",
    "ORIGO1": "While getting out of the train I have reached Origo shopping center which also connects with Riga Central Train Station. At this point I’m always happy to stretch my legs from about a 45-minute ride, but there are other people next to me who just as quickly want to get away from the train and the station, some of which showing bad manners that makes me annoyed, such as people who categorically refuse to maintain a two meter distance and wear masks properly. I remove the headphones to stop listening to music and continue on my way.",
    "ORIGO2": "There are cafes and a Narvesen kiosk in the mall where I use to pick up coffee to go to university. Sometimes when I go to Riga with my dad we both have coffee and before I go to university I have time to go to the Old Town together with him.",
    "ORIGO3": "But mostly I walk alone, passing through a tunnel that connects Origo, Stockmann supermarket and the pathway to the center of Riga. There is very little left until the university.",

    "RIGA_DESC": "Capital city",
    "RIGA1": "Riga is a unique capital. I am very fascinated by its atmosphere, familiar softness and interesting architecture. My dad is very educated in this field because he works for a construction company and sometimes when we walk he tends to tell interesting facts about some buildings. I myself have ever had the idea to become an architect, probably for this reason, but I could also mention the reason that I am also a big fan of \"LEGO\" and being smaller I created various constructions and buildings from these blocks.",
    "RIGA2": "A very beautiful river - Daugava - flows through Riga which has wide and beautiful views. Across it is Pardaugava which also astonishes with its uniqueness and romanticism and includes a story in each of its streets, for example, a story of how I grew up on one of these streets.",
    "RIGA3": "My journey from Origo to the university takes about 10 minutes. Fortunately this path although short takes on its beauty from the spring view of the park to the wonderful architecture of embassy, music school and the architecture of the university itself.",
